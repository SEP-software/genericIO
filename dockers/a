Traditional HPC IO approaches perform poorly in 
cloud environments. Object store architectures tend
to have high latencies and low bandwidth on a per
thread basis.  Performance can be improved dramitically
by break a dataset into blocks that are read in parallel.
By caching  blocks in main memory a users data access pattern
does not need to be changed.  Scientific data often can
be represented as regularly-sampled hypercubes. Often this
data can be compressed using lossy and lossless compession techniques.
By integrating these IO techniques into a library, IO performance in
cloud environments  can be improved by more than order of magnitude with
minimal changes to existing programs.
